# Tracking The "Intelligence" Genome

I have a very different attitude when it comes to where sexuality comes from, at least relative
to the norm anyway. You're probably asking yourself, "how is that supposed to be in regards to
intelligence or cognitive ability?" Well, Based on personal experience alone ***I know, that's
a small dataset*** but based on that data, I've been contemplating the idea that human sexuality
may be completely existing outside biologic influence. Unfortunately, the only way I can test
this (without invading the privacy of a large group of people who I don't know) is by completely
simulating the growth of an "intelligent" life-form. Because the true
line drawn for intelligent life is very blurred, I'm just opting to attempt emulation of the
human genome. But first, I need a few prerequisites, like a physical model, a way to animate
the particles in each cell and each cell in an organism. Both of those will be done in the
[Physics][1] project of mine, so here I'm going to be using those interfaces to build a simulation
that will enable me to track sexual habits of people based on genetics. To test once in for all
if genetics, or hormones have any affect on human sexuality. I favor the unpopular opinion that
our sexuality is all psychological. But I differ from the majority in the belief that we're all
Pansexual until the influences in our environment changes our ideas on what our ideal relationship
looks like.

I just realized a giant wall standing in my way. How am I supposed to overcome the memory requirements
needed to host the entire mapping of cells and particulates in a human body? More research is needed
it would seem. Perhaps an idea to carry over into the [Physics][1] project
"micro to macro signal compression using waveform expression".
